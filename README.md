A basic ticketing system that generates QR codes from a CSV file and verifies them through a web-based scanner.

## Features

- Generates an output file containing QR codes.
- Uses `html5-qrcode` to scan and validate tickets.
- Displays status messages: **Success**, **Failure**, or **Already Scanned**.

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/tmonga2208/ticket_checking_system.git
  cd ticket_checking_system
```

### 2. Generate QR Codes from CSV

```sh
  cd python_script
  python qrscript.py
```

This script:

  - ‚úÖ **Success**: Valid ticket.
  - ‚ùå **Failure**: Invalid ticket.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Already Scanned**: Ticket was used before.

## Technologies Used
